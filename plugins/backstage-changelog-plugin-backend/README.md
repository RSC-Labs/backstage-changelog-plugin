# @rsc-labs/changelog-plugin

Backstage Changelog Plugin is configurable and customizable plugin for viewing a changelog.
You can write your own parser or use default one, which follows [Keep the changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) notation.

### What is Changelog, why and who needs it?
Description from [Keep the changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.
It is being created to make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.
People need changelog. Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software are human beings who care about what's in the software. When the software changes, people want to know why and how.

# Getting started

If you haven't already, check out the [Backstage docs](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/) and create a Backstage application with
```
npx @backstage/create-app
```

Then, you will need to install and configure the changelog plugins for the frontend and the backend.
Frontend plugin installation can be found here: [Frontend plugin](https://github.com/RSC-Labs/backstage-changelog-plugin/tree/main/plugins/backstage-changelog-plugin)

## Backend plugin



Install:
```bash
cd packages/backend
yarn add @rsc-labs/backstage-changelog-plugin-backend
```

### Old backend system

Create a file `packages/backend/src/plugins/changelog.ts`:
```typescript
import {
    createRouter,
  } from '@rsc-labs/backstage-changelog-plugin-backend'
  import { Router } from 'express';
  import { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';
  
  export default async function createPlugin(
    env: PluginEnvironment,
  ): Promise<Router> {
    return await createRouter({
      discovery: env.discovery,
      tokenManager: env.tokenManager,
      logger: env.logger,
      reader: env.reader
    });
  }
```

Add the plugin to `packages/backend/src/index.ts`:
```typescript
// import:
import changelog from './plugins/changelog';
...

async function main() {
  ...
  // add env
  const changelogEnv = useHotMemoize(module, () => createEnv('changelog'));
  ...
  // add to router
  apiRouter.use('/changelog', await changelog(changelogEnv));
  ...
}
```

### New backend system

```typescript
backend.add(import('@rsc-labs/backstage-changelog-plugin-backend'));
```

### Configuration

Backend plugin supports 3 fields, which can be used for reading a Changelog.
Changelog itself is related to entity, so configuration is done by Annotations.
```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: example-website
  annotations:
    backstage.io/source-location: "file:/home/backstage/backstage-changelog/examples/"
    changelog-file-ref: "url:https://github.com/RSC-Labs/backstage-changelog-plugin/tree/main/CHANGELOG.md"
    changelog-name: "CHANGELOG_CUSTOM_NAME.md"

```
Plugin uses following logic:
1) If "changelog-file-ref" is provided it takes precedence over other options, so it is used for reading a Changelog
2) If not provided, then plugin check is "changelog-name" is provided. If yes, then it uses "backstage.io/source-location" as a location path together with "changelog-name"
3) If no above options are provided, plugin uses "backstage.io/source-location" for reading a file named "CHANGELOG.md".

Both "file" and "url" options are supported.
